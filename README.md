# JLR-Task-F1-API

The repository contains two python scripts. 
Both scripts are same. I created two different one's just in case if one doesn't work on some machines. 
The .ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook script while the other is a python script which can be run in visual studio code or any other python compiler. 
For the .py script, 'requests' module might need to be installed or imported using python installer or pip manager in the terminal.
